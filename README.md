# PRG3-AirPollutionMonitor

This is a Programming 3 Group Project titled "Air Pollution Monitor and Logging for Asthma Sufferers".

Air pollution is a significant danger to people with asthma, and living in an area that has low pollution can change their life experience. 

This project has several goals. To make an app that:- 

1. Allows people with asthma to log their use of their reliever (inhaler), prompt when they need to get a new one, and warn them if they are using it too often.  

2. Provides details of what they should do in an emergency. 

3. To provide information about different areas of London:- 

  a. To warn of high air pollution levels in the user's area,  

  b. To warn them about other areas that they should try and avoid 

  c. To try and identify the best places to live in London from the local authority's objectives, and by plotting the actual pollution history of the different sites within that local authority 

  d. To provide pollution news updates 

These objectives will make use of the Imperial Air Quality network API https://londonair.org.uk/Londonair/API/
